# ESPHome Pylontech RS485 Battery Emulator

An ESPHome component that allows an ESP device to emulate the Pylontech RS485 low-voltage battery protocol. This enables the use of DIY batteries or other battery management systems (like YAM-BMS) with inverters that expect to communicate with a Pylontech-compatible BMS.

## Key Features

*   **Dynamic Data:** Takes live data from ESPHome sensors to report battery status.
*   **Highly Configurable:** All parameters are configurable through your ESPHome YAML file.
*   **Protocol Emulation:** Replicates specific protocol quirks for compatibility with certain inverter brands.

## Project Status & Compatibility

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** The Pylontech RS485 protocol is not a strict standard. Different inverter manufacturers have implemented their own "dialects" with unique quirks.

This project was developed and tested specifically against an **SRNE-based inverter (rebranded as EcoWorthy)**. It successfully emulates the specific protocol quirks required by this family of inverters.

**Current Confirmed Working Inverters:**
*   SRNE
*   EcoWorthy (All-in-One models)

While the core logic may work for other inverters, it is not guaranteed. We welcome contributions and test reports for other brands.

### The "SRNE Dialect" Discovery

Through extensive reverse-engineering, we discovered that the SRNE inverter requires two key non-standard behaviors from the BMS:

1.  **Fixed Response Address:** The inverter polls multiple battery addresses, but it expects every response to come from the master battery address (`02`).
2.  **Structural Quirk in Frame `62H`:** The protocol has a non-standard format for the LENGTH field (`LCHKSUM` + `LENID`).

This emulator replicates these exact structural quirks to ensure full compatibility with SRNE-based inverters.

## Hardware Prerequisites

To use this component, you will need:

*   An ESP32 or ESP8266 based development board.
*   An RS485 to TTL converter module (e.g., MAX485 module) to interface with the inverter's RS485 port.

## Providing Battery Data (The Core Concept)

This component is designed to be controlled by standard ESPHome `sensor` entities. This allows you to feed it live battery data from any source, such as:

*   A dedicated BMS (Battery Management System) connected to your ESP device.
*   Template sensors that calculate values based on other inputs.
*   Input helpers (e.g., `number` entities in Home Assistant) for manual testing and simulation.

The `pylontech_rs485` component simply reads the `state` of the `sensor` entities you link to its configuration parameters.

## Full Example: Manual Testing with Home Assistant Sliders

The `pylontech-emulator-example.yaml` file in this repository provides a complete configuration for manual testing. This example sets up `number` entities (sliders) in Home Assistant, allowing you to simulate various battery parameters and observe the inverter's response.

### How the Example Works:

1.  **Global Variables:** `globals` are defined to store the current values of the simulated battery parameters (e.g., `g_soc`, `g_voltage`). These values are restored on reboot.
2.  **Home Assistant Sliders (`number` entities):** `number` entities are created, linked to the global variables. These appear as sliders in Home Assistant, allowing you to manually adjust the simulated SoC, voltage, current, etc. When you move a slider, its `set_action` updates the corresponding global variable.
3.  **Live Data Sensors (`template sensor` entities):** `template sensor` entities are defined. These sensors simply read the current `state` of the Home Assistant sliders (which in turn reflect the global variables).
4.  **Pylontech Component Linkage:** The `pylontech_rs485` component is configured to read its required data (SoC, voltage, current, etc.) directly from these `template sensor` entities.

This setup creates a clear data flow, allowing you to easily test the component's behavior with your inverter.
